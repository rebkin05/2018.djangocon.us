title: "Apply for Financial Aid!"
---
The Financial Aid application for DjangoCon US 2018 is now open! We are thrilled to support individuals who need financial assistance to attend DjangoCon US and aim to provide funds to a diverse group of attendees based on their need.  You can fill out the form [here](https://goo.gl/forms/0rgo8yT72CFMuGCx1).  

Each year we aim to help meet the cost of tickets, travel, and accommodation for attendees who need financial support. If you will not be able to attend DjangoCon US without financial help, we strongly encourage you to apply for financial aid.

Talk and tutorial presenters will be provided with free conference tickets to encourage wider participation from the Django community.

Applications need to be submitted by midnight on June 3rd [AoE](https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zones/aoe) in order to be considered.

More details about our financial aid process can be found on our [financial aid FAQ](https://2018.djangocon.us/financial-aid/#frequently-asked-questions).
